## Task
To implement an application for a transportation company's operations.

The task solution involves providing the ability for transportation companies to manage their activities more easily. Each transportation company has vehicles and employs staff. The primary activity of the company is to transport goods and people to different destinations. Each transport is characterized by a starting point, ending point, departure date, and arrival date. Additionally, it should be clear what exactly is being transported. If it's goods, the total weight of the cargo should be known. The company records the transports and the price for each transport service. The company's transportation vehicles vary in type: buses, trucks, tankers, etc. The drivers of these vehicles have different qualifications. For instance, qualifications for transporting special goods, including flammable items, transporting more than 12 people, and so on.
